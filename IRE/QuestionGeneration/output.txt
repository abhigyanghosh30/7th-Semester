The basic functional units of computer are made of electronics circuit and it works with electrical signal. The analog signals are continuousin nature and digital signals are discrete in nature. Computer is a digital device, which works on two levels of signal. We say these two levels of signal as Highand Low. This is one convention, which is known as positive logic. All thefunctionalities of computer can be captured with 0 and 1 and its theoretical background corresponds to two valuedWith the symbol 0 and 1, we have a mathematical system, which is knows as binary number system. Thisinformation is basically strings of 0s and 1s. This rapid rate of improvement has come both from advances in the technology used to build computers andfrom innovation in computer design. Butwhile describing computer system, we come across these terms, and in literature, computer scientists try to make aComputer architecture refers to those parameters of a computer system that are visible to a programmer orthose parameters that have a direct impact on the logical execution of a program. In addition, CPU may have some additional registers for temporary storage of data. Memory unit is used to store the data and program. This memory unit is termed as primary memory or main memory module. But in computer, we need more storage space for proper functioning of the Computer. Some of them are inside CPU, which are known as register. Other bigger junk of storage space is known asprimary memory or main memory. This is done by address of theWe need two operation to work with memory. READ Operation: This operation is to retrive the data from memory and bring it to CPU registerWRITE Operation: This operation is to store the data to a memory location from CPU registerWe need some mechanism to distinguish these two operations READ and WRITE.With the help of one signal line, we can differentiate these two operations. To transfer the data from CPU to memory module and vice-versa, we need some connection. Size of address bus depends on the memory size. We need some more instruction to work with the computer. So, we can design 8 newWe have added 6 new instructios. For example instructions are needed to take input fromWe need some other instructions to perform the output tasks. The structure of IAS computer is shown in the next page. The CPU of the IAScomputer consists of a data processing unit and a program control unit. The main action specified by instructions are performed by the arithmatic-logic circuitsThe control circuits in the program control unit are responsible for fetching instructions, decoding opcodes,controlling the information movements correctly through the system, and providing proper control signals for all CPUIt is used for storing programs and data. With the help of input devices we can storeinformation in memory so that CPU can use it.
